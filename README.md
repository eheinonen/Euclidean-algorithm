# Euclidean-algorithm
This is a small program demonstrating the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor, gcd(a,b), of two integers a and b. It also gives the least common multiple, lcm(a,b), via the formula gcd(a,b)*lcm(ab) = a*b.

While teaching basic number theory course at the University of Jyväskylä in Spring 2020, I was also self-studying a Java course. I decided to apply Java with some simple topic from the course.
